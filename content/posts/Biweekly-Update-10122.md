# Biweekly Update: 10/1/22 - 23/1/22
We started working on our elevator pitch. The pitch would cover the progress me made with the HCI portion of the module and the literature review while also detailing the future objectives. 
Additionally, we started creating a prototype using Figma of some new components, such as a pose importer, and our initial approach to the GUI redesign. 
We also started to do some research into how MotionInput stores pose data using MediaPipe. This is so we could see if there was a way to export this data and import it into game engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine to allow for full body motion capture without the need for any equipment.
We also started an initial testing phase of seeing how React would work instead of C# XAML, as React would allow for cross-platform compatibility.
