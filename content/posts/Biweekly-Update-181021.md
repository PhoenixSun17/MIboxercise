# Biweekly Update: 18/10/21 - 31/10/21
We started the HCI component of this module where we had to have an initial meeting with our client to understand the requirements of our project. The project was to create a boxercise and yogacise app that would use a webcam to recognise body movements and map them to key presses in gaming. We discussed the different possible user groups (e.g. children, elderly people, etc.) and how they would want to use the exercises mode of MotionInput.

We created some initial sketches of our deliverable and showed it to our client to see if they had any feedback, which we would then incorporate into our next version of the sketch. We also created some prototypes which gave a better indication of what the deliverable would look like.

Additionally, we led interviews with different personas to get a better understanding of what different users would want from the product and if they could see them using the product in the future. From these interviews and more discussion with the client, we had more information on what our deliverable should look like, and we changed our prototype to reflect this feedback.
