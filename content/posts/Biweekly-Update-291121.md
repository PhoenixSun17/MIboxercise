# Biweekly Update: 24/1/22 - 6/2/22
We presented our elevator pitch in front of our various clients.
Additionally, we also started creating our initial framework for the exercises module in React to get a better understanding of how the GUI would look and see how to connect the frontend to the backend. We started creating an image loader application that would allow users to upload an image, and have it recognised as a pose using MotionInput.
Furthermore, we continued work on the advanced exercises mode of the exercises module by improving the Figma prototype.
