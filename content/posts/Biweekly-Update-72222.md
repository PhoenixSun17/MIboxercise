# Biweekly Update: 7/2/22 - 20/2/22
We continued our React prototypes and tested out different functionalities such as implementing movement between different pages and sliders. However, in a design meeting it was announced that we would be moving back to working with C# XAML due to difficulties with React, so we started creating a XAML framework of our exercise module.
We also started working on a standalone pose upload and pose checker program as part of our submission to the hackathon. This program would allow a user to upload an image from the PC and have it compared to a target pose image and they would be told if they are making the correct pose or not. This is a proof of concept to show how computers can recognise different poses made using the body and could be used as a new way to train for martial arts and yoga.
