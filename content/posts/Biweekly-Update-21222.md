# Biweekly Update: 21/2/22 - 6/3/22
We attended a meeting with Microsoft to discuss the GUI we designed on Figma to receive feedback on how to improve it in regard to HCI. The feedback was constructive and useful and we were able to change our designs to reflect this feedback.
We also recorded testing videos for the Walking on the Spot micro-build.
Additionally, we continued development on our Pose Recogniser application for the hackathon and started development for our advanced exercises mode in XAML.
