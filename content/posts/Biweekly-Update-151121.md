# Biweekly Update: 15/11/21 - 28/11/21
We attended a meeting with the Irish Wheelchair association to discuss UCL-IBM FISE Social Isolation technologies and how MotionInput could be used to help people with accessible needs. We got to understand how the exercises module could help people with accessible needs participate in fitness and yoga, and how they different people would have different ranges of motion e.g. they can only move their arms up slightly, they cannot move their legs, etc.
We started the initial stages of discussing a GUI redesign of the exercises module with the rest of the people involved in the project and to talk more about the extremity triggers and how to improve them.
Additionally, we started testing out different games and controlled them using MotionInput to essentially turn it into a motion-controlled game. We aimed to test 30 different games of different genres ranging from racing to first person shooters. We wanted to see what games were enjoyable to play using MotionInput and what makes a game more enjoyable to play using MotionInput. From playing these games, we were able to share some feedback with our client and other developers about the pros and cons of using MotionInput to play games.
